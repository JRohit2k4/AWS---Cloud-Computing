**Amazon S3**  

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is one f the core building block of AWS and provides **infinitely scalable object storage**. Many websites and AWS services rely on S3 as a backend for storing and retrieving data.

---

**Key Charasteristics**

- Highly scalable and durable storage
- Used widely across AWS services
- Appears global, but buckets are region-specific
- Stores data as objects inside buckets

---

**Common Use Cases**  
Amazon S3 is used for:  
- Backup and Storage (files, disks, data)
- Disaster recovery (cross-region data backup)
- Archival storage (low-cost long-term storage using S3 Glacier)
- Hybrid cloud storage (on-prem + cloud)
- Hosting applications and media (images, videos)
- Data lakes and big data analytics
- Software delivery and updates
- Static website hosting

**Real-world examples:**
- NASDAQ stores 7 years of data in S3 Glacier
- Sysco runs analytics on S3 data to gain business insights

---

**Buckets**
- Buckets are top-level containers in S3
- Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS account
- created in specific AWS region
- S3 is global in service scope, but bucket location is regional (common beginner mistake)

**Bucket Naming Rules**
- 3–63 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No uppercase letters or underscores
- Must not be an IP address
- Must start with a lowercase letter or number

---

**Objects**
- Files stored in S3 are called **objects**
- Each object consist of:
  - **Key** (full file path)
  - **Value** (actual file content)

**Object Key**
- The key is the full path of the object
- Example:  
  ```folder1/folder2/myfile.txt```
- S3 does not have real directories
- "Folders" are just part of the object key
- Keys are made of:
  - **Prefix** -> folder path
  - **Object name** -> actual filename
 
---

**Object Size & Upload**
- Maximum object size: 5 TB
- For files larger than 5 GB, multipart upload is required
- Large files are split into multiple parts and uploaded separately

--- 

**Object Metadata & Tags**
- Objects can have:
  - Metadata (key-value pairs)
  - Tags (up to 10 Unicode key-value pairs)
- Tags are useful for:
  - Security
  - Lifecycle policies
  - Cost management
- Objects may also have a Version ID if versioning is enabled

--- 

**One-Line Exam Tip (Very Important)**
- Amazon S3 stores objects in buckets, bucket names are globally unique, buckets are region-based, and objects are identified using keys (full paths).
