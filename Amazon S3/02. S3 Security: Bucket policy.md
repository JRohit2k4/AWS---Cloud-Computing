**Amazon S3 - Security**  

Amazon S3 security is based on who can access the bucket or objects and under what conditions. Security is enforced using policies, ACLs, and encryption.

---

**1. User-Based Security (IAM Policies)**
- Uses IAM Policies attached to:
  - IAM users
  - IAM groups
  - IAM roles
- Defines which S3 API actions (like ```GetObject```, ```PutObject```) are allowed or denied
- Commonly used when:
  - An IAM user need to access to S3
  - An EC2 Instance accesses S3 using an IAM role
- Example
  - IAM user -> IAM policy -> access S3 object
 
 ---

 **2. Resource-Based Security (Bucket Policies)**
- Uses S3 Bucket Policies
- Policies are attached directly to the S3 bucket
- Written in JSON
- Can:
  - Allow  public access
  - Allow cross-account access
  - Enforce encrypption on uploads
- Bucket policies are now th most common and recommended way to secure S3

---

**3. Access Control List (ACLs)**
- Object ACLs
  - Fine-grained permissions at object level
  - Can be disabled
- Bucket ACLs
  - Less commonly used
  - Can also be disabled
- AWS recommends using Bucket Policies instead of ACLs

---

**4. When Can an IAM Principal Access an S3 Object?**
An IAM principal (user, role, service) can access an S3 object only if:
- IAM perission allow the action
  **OR**
- Bucket (resource) policy allows the action
- There is no explicit DENY
**Explicit DENY always overrides the action**
