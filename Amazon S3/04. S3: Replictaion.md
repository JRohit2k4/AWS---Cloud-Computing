**Amazon S3 - Replication**  

**Amazon S3 Replication** allows you to automaticalls copy objects from one S3 bucket to another asynchronously.  

There are two types of replication:

---

**1. Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**
- Replicates objects across different AWS regions
- Source and destination buckets must be in different regions

Common Use Cases:
- Compliance requirements
- Lower latency access for users in another region
- Cross-account data replication
- Disaster recovery

---

**2. Same-Region Replication (SRR)**
- Replicates objects within the same AWS region
- Source and destination buckets are in same region

Common Use Cases:
- Aggregating logs from multiple buckets
- Replicating data between production and test accounts
- Live data replication for internal workflows

---

**Key Requirements**
- Versioning must be ended on:
  - Source bucket
  - Destination bucket
- Replication works:
  - Asynchronously
  - In the background
- Buckets can be:
  - In the same AWS account
  - In the different AWS accounts
 
---

**IAM Permissions**  
- Proper IAM permissions must be granted
- S3 service needs permission to:
  - Read from the source bucket
  - Write to the destination bucket
 
---

**One-Line Exam Tip**  

- **S3 Replication automatically copies objects asynchronously between buckets, using CRR for different regions and SRR for the same region, with versioning enabled on both buckets.**
