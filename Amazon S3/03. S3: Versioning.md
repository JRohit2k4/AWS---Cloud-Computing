**Amazon S3 - Versioning**  

S3 Versioning allows you to keep multiple versions of the same object in a bucket.  
It is a bucket-level setting and must be explicitly enabled.  

---

**What happens when versioning is enabled?**
- Every time an object is uploaded:
  - S3 creates a new version
- If the same object (same key) is uploaded again:
  - S3 does not overwrite
  - It creates Version 2, Version 3, etc.  

The object key stays the same, but version change

---

**Why use versioning? (This is the important part)**
**1. Protection Against Accidental Deletes**
- Deleting an object:
  - Does not remove it permanently
  - Adds a delete marker
- Older version still exist
- You can restore deleted files

---

2️⃣ Easy Rollback
- You can roll back to:
  - A previous version
  - A version from days ago

- Useful for:
  - Website updates
  - Configuration changes

**Best Practice**

Especially useful for:  
- Websites
- Critical data
- Backup-related buckets

  - Does NOT delete existing versions
  - Is a safe operation
- Old versions remain available
