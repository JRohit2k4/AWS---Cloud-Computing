**S3 - Storage Classes**  

1. Amazon S3 Standard-General purpose
2. Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequet Access (IA)
3. Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
4. Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
5. Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
6. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Retrieval
7. Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

- Can move object between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configuration

**Durability and Availability**

- **Durability**
  - High durability (99.999999999%, 11 9's) of objects across multiple AZ
  - If you store 10,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
  - Same for all storage classes
 
- **Availability**
  - Measures how readily a service is
  - varies depending on storage class
  - Example S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year
 
---

**1. S3 standard (General Purpose)**
- Default storage class
- Frequent accessed data
- Low latency, high throughput
- 99.99 availability

Use cases:
- Websites
- Big analytics
- Mobile and gaming apps
- Content distribution

---

**2. S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)**
- Less frequent accessed data
- Rapid access when needed
- Lower cost than standard
- Retrieval cost applies
- 99.9& availability

Use cases:
- Backups
- Disaster recovery

---

**3. S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)
- Data stored in single AZ
- Lower availability (99.5%)
- Data lost if AZ is destroyed

Use cases:
- Secondary backups
- Re-creatable data
- On-prem backup copies

---

**Glacier Storage Classes**  
All Glacier classes:  
- Low-cost storage
- Pay for storage + retrieval
- Used for backups and archives

---

**4. Glacier Instant Retrieval**
- Miliseconds retrieval
- Data accessed once per quarter
- Minimum storage: 90 days

Use case:
- Archive data that still needs fast access

---

**5. Glacier Flexible Retrieval**
- Formerly "S3 Glacier"
- Retrieval options:
  - Expedited: 1-5 minutes
  - Standard: 3-5 hours
  - Bulk: 5-12 hours (cheap/free)
- Minimum storage: 90 days

Use case:
- Archive data where wait time is acceptable

---

**6. Glacier Deep Archive**
- Cheapest storage
- Long-term archival
- Retrieval:
  - Standard: 12 hours
  - Bulk: 48 hours
- Minimum storage: 180 days

Use case:
- Compliance
- Legal records
- Long-term backups

---

**7. S3 Intelligent-Tiering (Set it & Forget it)**
- Automatically moves object between tiers
- Based on access patterns
- Small monthly monitoring fee
- **No retrieval charges**

**Tiers include**
- Frequent Access (default)
- Infrequent Access
- Archive Instant Access
- Archive Access (optional)
- Deep Archive Access (optional)

Best for:
- Unknown or changing access patterns
- When you don't want to manage tiers manually

---

**Lifecycle Rules (Important Concept)**
- Automatically move objects between storage classes
- Based on:
  - Age of object
  - Access patterns

Example:
- Move from Standard -> IA -> Glacier automatically

---

**Bullet-points**
- S3 Standard = frequent access
- IA = infrequent but fast access
- One Zone-IA = single AZ, cheaper, riskier
- Glacier = archive
- Deep Archive = cheapest, slowest
- Intelligent-Tiering = automatic movement
- Durability = same for all (11 nines)

--- 

**One-Line Exam Tip:**
**Choose S3 storage classes based on access frequency, retrieval time, and cost—not durability, because durability is the same across all classes.**
