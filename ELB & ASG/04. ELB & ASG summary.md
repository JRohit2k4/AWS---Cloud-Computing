**ELB & ASG — FINAL EXAM SUMMARY (CRISP)**  

**Core Cloud Concepts**

- **High Availability (HA)**  
→ Application running in multiple Availability Zones  
→ Protects against AZ failure

- **Vertical Scaling**  
→ Increase instance size (scale up/down)

- **Horizontal Scaling**  
→ Increase number of instances (scale out/in)

- **Elasticity**  
→ Automatic scaling based on demand  
→ Scale up when load increases, scale down when it drops

- **Agility**  
→ Ability to create/delete resources quickly  
→ Faster experimentation & development

**Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**

- Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances
- Works across multiple AZs
- Performs health checks
- Provides single DNS endpoint

**Types of Load Balancers**
| Load Balancer | Layer   | Key Use Case                      |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| **ALB**       | Layer 7 | HTTP / HTTPS routing              |
| **NLB**       | Layer 4 | TCP / UDP, ultra-high performance |
| **GWLB**      | Layer 3 | Firewalls, traffic inspection     |
| Classic       | —       | ❌ Deprecated                      |

**Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

- Increases number of instances as required
- Maintains min / desired / max capacity
- Replace unhealthy instances
- Works tight with ELB

**Scaling Strategies**

- Manual → You change capacity
- Dynamic
  - Simple / Step → CloudWatch alarms
  - Target Tracking → Maintain a target (e.g. CPU 40%)
- Scheduled → Known time-based scaling
- Predictive → ML-based future traffic prediction

**ELB + ASG**
- High Availability
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- Cost optimization
- Fault tolerance

**30-Second Exam Lock**  

If a question mentions:
- Multiple AZs → High Availability
- Auto scale with demand → ASG + Elasticity
- HTTP/HTTPS routing → ALB
- TCP / millions req/sec → NLB
- Firewalls / inspection → GWLB
