**1️. Scalability** = “Can my system handle more load?”

Two ways:

---

**a. Vertical Scalability (Scale Up / Down)**  

**What it is?**
- Increase **instance size**
- Example: ```t2.micro -> t2.large```

**Real meaning**
- Same machine, more power (CPU/RAM)

**Used for**
- Databases
- Non-distributed systems

**Limits**
- Hardware ceiling (you can't scale forever)

**Exam trigger words**  
"Increase instance size", "bigger EC2", "more RAM/CPU"

---

**b. Horizontal Scalability (Scale Out / In)**

**What it is?**
- Increase **number of instances**
- Example: 1 EC2 -> 6 EC2

**Requires**
- Distributed system
- Load balancer

**Used for**
- Web apps
- Modern cloud-native apps

**Exam trigger words**  
"Add instances", "distributed", "stateless", "scale out"

---

**2. High Availability (HA)**

**High Availability means**
- App runs in multiple Availability Zones
- Survives AZ / data center failure

**Key point**
- HA is about failure, not load

**Exam trigger words**    
"Multi-AZ", "survive data center loss", "fault tolerant"

**3. How EC2 achieves this in AWS**

| Concept              | AWS Tool                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Vertical scaling     | Change EC2 instance type |
| Horizontal scaling   | Auto Scaling Group       |
| Traffic distribution | Load Balancer            |
| High Availability    | Multi-AZ ASG + LB        |

**Important**
Horizontal scaling + Multi AZ = High Availability

---

**4. VERY IMPORTANT EXAM DEFINITION (memorize)**
**Scalability:**
- Ability to handle increased load by **scaling in** and **scaling out**

**Elasticity**
- Ability to automatically scale based on demand

Key ideas
- Auto Scaling
- Pay only for what you use
- Match supply to demand

If you see **"automatic"**, think Elasticity

---

**Agility (DISTRACTOR)**

**Not related to scaling**

**Means**
-Spin up resources fast
- Minutes instead of weeks

**Exam trick:**
If question asks about scaling → agility is wrong

---

**One-line memory cheatsheet**

- **Vertical** → Make box bigger
- **Horizontal** → Get more boxes
- **High Availability** → Boxes in different AZs
- **Elasticity** → Auto scale
- **Agility** → Fast provisioning (not scaling)

---

**Reality check (answer mentally)**

1. App automatically adds EC2s during traffic spikes → Elasticity
2. Increase instance from t2.micro to t3.large → Vertical scaling
3. App survives AZ failure → High Availability
4. Add more EC2 instances → Horizontal scaling
