**Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**

**What is ELB?**
- ELB is a managed AWS service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- Gives one DNS entry point for users.
- Improves scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.
- AWS handles maintenance, scaling, health checks, and availability.

---

**Why use a Load Balancer?**
- Distributes traffic across instances
- Handles instance failures using health checks
- Enables SSL termination (HTTPS)
- Works across multiple Availability Zones
- Improves high availability & elasticity

**Types of Load Balancers (VERY IMPORTANT)** 

**1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

- Layer 7
- Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC
- Best for: Web applications
- Supports path-based & host-based routing
- Example: ```/login```, ```/api```

**Exam keyword**: HTTP routing → ALB

---

**2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
- Layer 4
- Protocols: TCP ,UDP
- Ultra-high performance (millions of requests/sec)
- Provides static IP (Elastic IP)

**Exam keyword**: High performance / TCP / static IP -> NLB

---

**3. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**
- Layer 3
- Protocol: GENEVE
- Used for firewalls, IDS, deep packet inspection
- Routes traffic to security appliances on EC2

**Exam keyword**: Firewall / traffic inspection -> GWLB

---

**4. Classic Load Balancer**
- Old generation
- Deprecated / retired

---

**High Availability with ELB**
- ELB runs across multiple AZs
- If one AZ or instance fails -> adds/removes EC2 instances
- Survives data center failures

---

**ELB vs Auto Scaling**
- ELB = distributed traffic
- Auto Scaling Groups -> adds/removes EC2 instances
- Together = Elastic, scalable architecture

**Exam Trap Words to Remember**

| Word        | Meaning                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Scalability | Ability to handle more load                |
| Elasticity  | Auto scaling based on demand               |
| Agility     | Faster resource provisioning (NOT scaling) |

**1-Line Exam Memory Hook**
- **ALB = HTTP, NLB = TCP + Speed, GWLB = Firewall**
