**Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

**What problem does ASG solve?**  

Website traffic changes over time (day vs night).
You don’t want:
- Too few servers → app crashes ❌
- Too many servers → wasted money ❌

ASG fixes this automatically.

**What is an Auto Scaling Group?**   
An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) automatically:
- Adds EC2 instances when traffic increases (scale out)
- Removes EC2 instances when traffic decreases (scale in)

This is called elasticity.

---

**Key ASG settings (VERY IMPORTANT for exam)**

Every ASG has 3 numbers:

**1. Minimum size**
→ Lowest number of EC2 instances (e.g. 1)

**2. Desired capacity**
→ Number of instances you want right now
→ Usually the current running count

**3. Maximum size**
→ Upper limit (e.g. 5)

ASG always keeps instances between min and max.

---

**ASG + Load Balancer (they work together)**

- Load Balancer receives traffic
- ASG creates EC2 instances
- New EC2 instances are automatically registered with the Load Balancer
- Removed EC2 instances are deregistered

👉 You never manually attach instances.

**Health checks (EXAM FAVORITE ⭐)**

If an EC2 instance becomes unhealthy:
- ASG terminates it
- ASG launches a new healthy instance

This improves availability.

---

 **Why ASG is powerful**
- Handles traffic automatically
- Saves cost (pay only for what you use)
- Works across multiple AZs
- Replaces failed instances
- Core concept of cloud elasticity

**One-line exam memory**

**ASG = automatically add/remove EC2 instances to match load and save cost**
