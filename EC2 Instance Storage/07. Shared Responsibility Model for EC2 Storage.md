**Shared Responsibility Model — EC2 Storage (Exam View)**

**✅ AWS is responsible for**
- Physical infrastructure (data centers, hardware)
- Hardware-level replication for:
  - EBS
  - EFS
- Replacing failed disks / hardware
- Preventing AWS employees from accessing your data

👉 If the question mentions hardware failure or replication at the storage service level → AWS responsibility

---

**✅ YOU (customer) are responsible for**

- Backups & snapshots
  - EBS snapshots
  - EFS backups (via AWS Backup)

- Encryption
  - At rest
  - In transit

- Your data
  - What you store
  - What you delete

- Risk awareness
  - Especially EC2 Instance Store (ephemeral)

👉 If the question mentions losing data, encryption, snapshots, or instance store risk → Your responsibility
