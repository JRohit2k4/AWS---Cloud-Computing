**EC2 Instance Store**

**What is EC2 Instance Store**
- EC2 Instace store is a local storage physical attached to the host machine
- It is hardware disk storage, not network-based
- Also called **Ephemeral Storage**

Think of it as:  
A local SSD/HDD inside the physical server running your EC2 instance

---

**Why Use Instance Store?**
- Extremely high performance
  - Very low latency
  - Very high IOPS

- Better performance than EBS because:
  - No network involved
  - Direct hardware access

⚠️ Exam phrase:  
“Highest I/O performance” → Instance Store

---

**The Big Catch (VERY IMPORTANT)**

- Data is lost if:
  - Instance is stopped
  - Instance is terminated
  - Underlying hardware fails

That’s why it’s called:  
👉 Ephemeral storage

---

**Is It Durable?**
- NO
- Not for long-term storage
- No snapshots
- No detach / reattach
  
If the server dies → your data dies

---

**Who Is Responsible for Backups?**

**👉 YOU**

AWS does not:
- Replicate instance store data
- Back it up
- Recover it
  
This contrasts with EBS, where AWS handles durability.

---

**Best Use Cases**
- Instance Store is ideal for:
- Cache
- Buffers
- Scratch space
- Temporary files
- High-performance workloads

**Not suitable for:**
- Databases
- Long-term storage
- Critical data

**Instance Store vs EBS (High-Yield Table)**

| Feature       | **Instance Store** | **EBS**        |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Storage type  | Local              | Network        |
| Performance   | 🔥 Very High       | High           |
| Persistence   | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes          |
| Snapshots     | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes          |
| Detach/Attach | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes          |
| Use case      | Cache / Temp       | Long-term data |

CCP Memory Lock 🔒
- Temporary + fast → Instance Store
- Persistent + flexible → EBS  
If you remember just this, you’ll eliminate wrong options instantly.
