**Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

- **EBS = Elastic Block Store**
- It is a network-attached block storage for EC2 Instances.
- Think of it like a network **USB drive** that you can attach to an EC2 instance.

**Key characteristics**:
1. **Persistent**

- Data on EBS volume persist even after instance is terminated (unless delete-on-termination is enabled).
- You can:
  - Terminate an instance
  - Launch a new one
  - Attach the same EBS volume
  - Get your data back

This is the **main purpose of EBS**

2. **Network Drive (Not physical)**

- EBS volumes are not physically inside the EC2 instance
- Communication happens over the network
- Because of this:
  - There may be slightly latency
  - But they are easy to detach & reattach

---

3. **One Instance at a Time (CCP Level)**
- At the Cloud Practioneer Level:
  - One EBS volume -> one EC2 instance
  - cannot be attached to another multiple instances at the same time
However:
- One EC2 Instance can have multiple EBS Volumes attached at a time.

Think:
- One computer with multiple USB drives

---

4. **Availability zone**

- An EBS volume is locked to a single Availability Zone
- Example:
  - EBS in ```us-east-1a```
  - Cannot attach to an EC2 in ```us-east-1b```

Common exam trap  
Exception:
- If you create a snapshot , you can restore it in another AZ or region

---

5. **Detachable & Reusable**

- EBS volume can be:
  - Created
  - Left unattached
  - Attached later on demand

This makes them great to:
- Failover
- Data Recovery
- Instance replacement

---

6. **Provisioned Storage**

- You must define capacity in advance:
  - Size (GB)
  - Performance (IOPS)

Billing:
- You are billed for provisioned capacity, not actual usage

You can:
- Increase the size later
- Improve performance later

**Delete on Termination**
**What is this?**
- A setting that controls whether the EBS volume is deleted when the EC2 instance is terminated.

**Default Behaviour**:

| Volume Type            | Delete on Termination |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Root Volume            | ✅ Enabled             |
| Additional EBS Volumes | ❌ Disabled            |

**Why this matters**:
- If enabled -> volume is deleted with the instance
- If disable -> volume survives after instance termination

**Exam Use Case:**  
“You want to preserve data even after the EC2 instance is terminated”  
✅ Disable delete on termination, especially for the root volume

---

**CCP Exam Summary (Memorize This)**

- EBS = persistent block storage
- Network-attached (not physical)
- Bound to one AZ
- One instance at a time
- Can be detached and reattached
- Must provision size & IOPS
- Delete on termination is configurable
