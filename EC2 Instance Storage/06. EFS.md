**Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**

**What EFS is?**
- Managed Network File system (EFS)
- Shared storage for EC2
- Can be mounted to hundreds of EC2 instances at a same time
- Linux only

---

**Key Capabilities**

**Multi-Instance Access**
- Unlike EBS -> EFS can be attached to many EC2 instances simultaneously
- All instances see the same files

**Multi-AZ by Default**
- Works across multiple Availability Zones
- EC2 in AZ-A, AZ-B, AZ-C can all mount the same EFS
- This makes EFS highly available

**Fully Managed & Scalable**
- No capacity planning
- Automatically scales up/down
- You pay only for what you store

---

**Cost-Reality**
- **EXPENSIVE**
- Roughly ~3x more expensive than gp2 EBS
- But:
  - No provisioning
  - Pay per GB

Exam logic:  
"Shared, multi-AZ, scalable, but expensive" -> **EFS**

---

**EBS vs EFS (This will be tested)**

**EBS**
- Attached to one EC2
- Exists in one AZ
- To move AZ to AZ -> Snapshot + Restore
- Snapshot copy = NOT live sync

**EFS**
- Attached to many EC2s
- Works across AZs
- Same files visible anywhere
- True shared filesystem

Exam shortcut:  
- Single instance storage -> EBS
- Shared storage across instaces/AZs -> EFS

---

**EFS Storage Classes (Know this name)**

**EFS Standard**
- Frequently accessed files

**EFS-IA (Infrequent Access)
- Files not accessed often
- Controlled by Lifecycle policy

---

**Lifecycle Policy (Exam Concept)**

- Automatically moves files:
  - Example: “Move files not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA”

- If file is accessed again:
  - Automatically moves back to EFS Standard

- Transparent to applications
  - Apps don’t know or care
 
---

**One-line Exam Definitions**

- **EFS** = Shared, multi-AZ, Linux only file system for EC2
- **EFS-IA** = Low-cost storage for infrequently accessed files
- **Lifecycle Policy** = Automatically mmoves files between storage classes
