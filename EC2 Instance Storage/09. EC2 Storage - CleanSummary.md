**EC2 Storage – Clean Final Summary**

**1. EBS (Elastic Block Store)**
- Network-based block storage
- attached to one EC2 instance at a time
- Bound to a single AZ
- Data persist even if EC2 instance is terminated (unless delete-on-termination is enabled)
- Snapshots:
  - Used for backups
  - Can restore volumes in another AZ or region
- You must provision sizze and performance (IOPS) in advance

*Think: "Network USB stick for one EC2"*

---

**2. AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**
- A template for EC2 instances
- contains:
  - OS
  - Configuration
  - Installed software
- Benefits
  - Faster launch time
  - Consistent Enviroment
- Types:
  - AWS-provides
  - Custom AMI
  - Marketplace AMI
- Region-specific, but can be copied across regions

---

**3. EC2 Image Builder**
- Automates AMI creation
- Automatically:
  - Builds
  - Tests
  - Validates
  - Distributes AMI
- Can run on a schedule
- Free service (you pay only for EC2 + storage used)

*Think: "Factory of AMIs"*

---

**4. EC2 Instance Store**

- Physical disk attached to the EC2 host
- Very high performance (millions of IOPS)
- Ephemeral storage
  - Data is lost if instance stops or terminates
- Best for:
  - Cache
  - Buffers
  - Temporary data
- YOU are responsible for backups

*Think: “Fast but temporary local disk”*

---

**5. EFS (Elastic File System)**
- Managed Network File System
- Works only with Linux
- Can be attached to multiple EC2 instances at a time
- Multi-AZ, region-level
- Highly available and Scalable
- Pay only for what you use
- More expensive than EBS

EFS-IA(Infrequent Access)
- Automatically moves files that are unused for 60 days to cheaper storage
- Transparent to applications
- Used for cost optimization

*Think: "Shared Linux folder across AZs"*

---

**6. Amazon FSx**

Managed third-party file system

**FSx for Windows File Server**
- Windows-based shared file system
- Uses SMB & NTFS
- Integrates with Active Directory
- For Windows EC2

*Think: "Windws file server on AWS"*

---

**FSx for Lustre**
- High Performance Computing (HPC)
- Linux-based
- Millions of IOPS, sub-millisecond latency
- Used for:
  - ML
  - Analytics
  - Video processing
- Can integrate with S3

*Think: "Extreme performance Linux storage"* 

---

**7. Shared Responsibility (Storage)**

**AWS is responsible for:**
- Physical infrastructure
- Hardware failures
- Replication

**You are responsible for:**
- Snapshots & backups
- Encryption
- Data written to disks
- Instance Store data protection

---

**Exam Mental Map**

- One EC2, durable → EBS
- Shared Linux, multi-AZ → EFS
- Windows shared storage → FSx Windows
- HPC & extreme performance → FSx Lustre
- Fast but temporary → Instance Store
- Prebuilt EC2 template → AMI
