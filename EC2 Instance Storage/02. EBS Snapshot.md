**EBS Snapshot**

**What is an EBS snapshot?**
- An EBS Snapshot is a backup of an EBS volume
- It captures the state of the volume at a point in time
- Stored independently from the EC2 instance

Even if:
- The EC2 instance is terminated
- The EBS volume is deleted

You can restore the data from the data from the snapshot

---

**Do You Need to Stop or Detach the Volume?**

- ❌ Not required  
- ✅ Recommended (for data consistency)

Exam wording you may see:  
“Snapshots can be taken while the volume is in use”  
✔️ True

**Where Do Snapshots Live?**

- Snapshots are regional
- Created in one AWS Region
- Can be used to:
  - Restore EBS volumes in different AZs
  - Be copied to other regions

**Moving EBS Data Across AZs (Very Common Exam Flow)**

1. EBS volume in ```us-east-1a```
2. Create a snapshot
3. Restore snapshot → new EBS volume in ```us-east-1b```
4. Attach to EC2 in us-east-1b

❌ You cannot directly move an EBS volume across AZs  
✅ Snapshot is the bridge

**Snapshot Features (Know These)**

**1. EBS Snapshot Archive**
- Move snapshots to archive tier
- 75% cheaper
- Restore time: 24–72 hours

Use case:

- Long-term backups
- Not needed urgently

⚠️ Exam trap:

Archive = cheap but slow restore

---

**2. Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots**
- Protects against accidental deletion
- Deleted snapshots go to Recycle Bin
- Retention: 1 day to 1 year
- After retention → permanently deleted

By default:
- ❌ No recycle bin
- ❌ Delete = gone forever

---

**CCP Memory Anchors 🧠**

- Snapshot = backup
- Snapshot = point-in-time
- Snapshot = AZ & Region mobility
- Archive = cheap, slow
- Recycle bin = accidental delete protection
