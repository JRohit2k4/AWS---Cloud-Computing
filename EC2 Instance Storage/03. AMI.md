**Amazon AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**

**What is an AMI?**
- AMI = Amazon Machine Image
- It is a template used to launch EC2 instances
- An AMI represents a customized EC2 environment

Think of it as:
- A pre-built snapshot of an EC2 instance configuration

---

**What does an AMI contains?**
- OS (Linux, Windows, etc)
- Installed softwares
- Configuration settings
- Monitoring tools
- Application code (if you add it)

Result:
- Faster boot time
- Faster configuration
- Consistent environment

This is a big reason companies use AMIs.

**Types of AMI**

1. **Public AMIs (AWS-provided)**
- Created and mailtained by AWS
- Example:
  - Amazon Linux 2
- Used by default in most tutorials

Free (you pay onlly for EC2 resources)

---

2. **Custom AMIs (Your Own)**
- You create and maintain them
- Built for:
  - An existing EC2 instance
- You are responsible for:
  - Updates
  - Security patches
  
Benefits:
  - Exact control
  - Faster deployment

---

3. **AWS Marketplace AMIs**
- Created by third-party vendors
- May includes:
  - Databases
  - Firewalls
  - Enterprises software
Often paid
- You paid
  - EC2
  - Software license

Exam keyword:
"Preconfigured third-party software" -> Marketplace AMI

---

**AMI and Regions**
- AMI are region specific
- An AMI created in ```us-east-1```
  - Cannot be used directly in another region
  - Can be copied to another region
 
This allow you to:
- Deploy identical EC2 instances globally

---

**AMI Creation Process**
1. Launce the EC2 instance
2. Customize it (install software, config)
3. Stop instance (recommended for data integrity)
4. Create AMI
  - AWS automatically creates EBS snapshots 
5. Launch new EC2 instances from the AMI

Exam wording:  
"Creating an AMI also creates EBS snapshot behing the scenes"  
TRUE

---

**Copying an EC2 Setup Across AZs**
- AMI is created in a region
- EC2 instances launched from that AMI can be in:
  - ```us-east-1a```
  - ```us-east-1b```
  - Any AZ in that region

So:
- EBS volumes are AZ-bound
- AMIs are region-bound

Very common confusion on exams

---

**CCP Memory Anchors 🧠**

- AMI = EC2 template
- AMI = faster launch
- AMI = OS + software + config
- AMI = region-specific
- Marketplace AMI = third-party + paid
