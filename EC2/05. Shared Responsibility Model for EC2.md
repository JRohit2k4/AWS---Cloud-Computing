**Shared Responsibiltities Model for EC2**
AWS follows the **Shared Responsibility Model**, which means security is shared between AWS and you.


🔹 **AWS is responsible for (Security of the Cloud)**:

- **Physical data centers**
- **Hardware infrastructure**
- **Physical host isolation**
- **Replacing faulty hardware**
- **Meeting compliance & regulatory standards**

👉 You **do not** manage or worry about the physical servers.

🔹 **You are responsible for (Security in the Cloud)**:

- **Security Groups** (firewall rules: who can access your EC2)
- **Operating System** (Linux/Windows updates & patches)
- **Installed software & utilities**
- **IAM Roles & permissions**
- **Data security** (encryption, access, backups)

👉 AWS gives you the VM, **you own and manage everything inside it**.

**One-line exam rule to remember** 🧠

  - **AWS secures the infrastructure, YOU secure what runs on it.**
