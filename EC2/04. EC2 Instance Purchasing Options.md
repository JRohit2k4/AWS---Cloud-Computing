**EC2 Instance Purchasing Options**

This chapter explains the **different ways you can buy and run EC2 instances** in AWS, depending on **cost, duration, flexibility and reliability needs**. Instead of using only On-Demand instaces, AWS provides multiple purchasing options to **optimized cost and capacity** for different workloads.

---

**What this Chapter teaches you**

**1. On-Demand Instances**
- Pay only for what you use (per second or per hour).
- No upfront payment, no long-term commitment.
- **Highest cost**, but **maximum flexibility**
- Best for:
  - Short-term workloads
  - Unpredictable usage
  - Testing, development, sudden spikes

**Exam hint**
In this question says *short-term, unpredictable, no commitment* -> **On-Demand**

---

**2. Reserved Instances (RI)**
- Commit for **1 year or 3 years**
- Upto **72% cheaper** than **On-Demand**.
- You reserve:
  - Instances type
  - Region/AZ
  - OS
  - Tenancy
- Best for:
  - Long-running workloads
  - Databases
  - Steady-state applications

**Convertible Reserved Instances**
- Slightly less discount (up to 66%)
- You can change:
  - Instance type
  - Instance family
  - OS
  - Tenancy
- Used when flexibility is needed.

**Exam hint**
*Long-term + predictable usage* -> **Reserved Instance**
*Long-term but need flexibility* -> **Convertible RI**

---

**3. Saving Plans**
- Commit to **spending a fixed amount ($/hour) for 1 or 3 years**.
- Discount similar to Reserved Instances (~70%)
- More flexible than RIs:
  - Change instance size
  - Change OS
  - Change tenancy
- Locked to:
  - Instances family
  - Region

**Exam hint**:
*Long-term usage but want flexibility without locking instance type* -> **Saving Plan**

---

**4. Spot Instances**
- Up to **90% discount**
- AWS can terminate the instance **at any time**
- Best for:
  - Batch jobs
  - Data processing
  - Image rendering
  - Fault-tolerant workloads
- NOT suitable for:
  - Databases
  - Critical applications

**Exam hint**:
*Cheapest + can be interrupted* -> **Spot Instance**

---

5. Dedicated Hosts
- You get a full physical server.
- Most expensive option.
- Used for:
  - Compliance requirements
  - Bring Your Own License (BYOL)
  - Per-socket / per-core licensing

**Key difference**:
- You control physical server placement
- Visibility into hardware

**Exam hint**:
*Compliance + licensing + physical server access* → **Dedicated Host**

---

6. Dedicated Instances
- Hardware is dedicated to you
- No control over physical server
- May share hardware with other instances in **same AWS account**  
Exam tip:
 - Dedicated Host = Physical server control
 - Dedicated Instances = dedicated hardware, no server responsibility

---

7. Capacity Reservation
- Reserve **capacity in a specific AZ**
- No discount
- You pay **even if you don't use it**
- Guarantees availability  
- Best for: 
  - Short-term but **must-run workloads**
  - AZ-specific requirements
**exam hint**:
*Need guaranteed capacity in an AZ* -> **Capacity Reservation**
